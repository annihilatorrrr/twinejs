# Publishing a Story

Publishing a story creates an HTML file that can opened in a web browser.

You can publish a story from both the _Story Library_ and _Story Map_ screens.

- In the Story Library screen, select the story, then choose _Publish to File_
  from the _Build_ top toolbar tab.
- In the Story Map screen, choose _Publish to File_ from the _Build_ top toolbar
  tab.

Twine will then ask you to choose a file name and location to save your
published file. The file name you choose doesn't affect the name of your story
in its published form. In other words, if you publish a story named "My Best
Story" in your library to a file named `my-worst-story.html`, the story will
still show its title as "My Best Story" in a web browser. If you'd like to
change the name of your story in its published form, [rename
it](../editing-stories/renaming.html) before publishing.

Some versions of the Safari web browser may instead open a browser tab with an
address that begins with `blob://`. If this happens, choose _Save As_ from
Safari's _File_ menu to save your story to a file.

## Now That I Have a Published File, What Do I Do?

The short answer is that you can publish your story anywhere an HTML file can be
published. You could send this directly to people using email or publish it to a
web site. Some cloud file hosting services might allow you to publish your file
in a web-accessible form, but many limit this functionality so that a story can
only be downloaded by viewers, not directly played in a brwoser.

Two services that offer Twine-specific hosting are
[Borogove](https://borogove.app) and [Itch.io](https://itch.io). Itch is more of
a marketplace, while Borogove is more closely aligned with the interactive
fiction community.
