# 2.9 versions

## 2.9.1

Release Date: July 21, 2024

## Bugs Fixed

- Importing a story in browser Twine that replaces an existing one no longer creates duplicate stories.

## Behind the Scenes

- Many libraries used by Twine have been updated, and some which have been
  superceded by built-in browser functionality have been removed.

## Story Format Updates

- SugarCube has been updated to version [2.37.0](http://www.motoslave.net/sugarcube/2/releases.php).

## 2.9.0

Release Date: June 16, 2024

## New Features Added

- Browser Twine can now be installed as a progressive web application (PWA).
  This is an early feature and bugs may exist with it. Please bear in mind that
  although PWAs allow for use offline, backups are still important to keep, as
  their data may be deleted when clearing browsing data.
- A `data-tag` attribute is added to passage cards in the story map, which can
  be targeted using custom CSS. It otherwise doesn't have any effect in the
  story map.

## Bugs Fixed

- The story library now sorts correctly by date.
- An error in the Italian localization has been fixed.
